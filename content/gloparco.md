![Author Picture](/gloparco.jpeg) Hi there, I am Gene Loparco, a family guy with a tech-consulting day job, and an entrepreneurial itch.  I have been working in the IT industry for 25 years now, so Iâ€™m really rather old.  I have held various titles and have worked for companies ranging from the Fortune 100 to a dot-com bust.

Right now I am spending most of my time developing apps and games using geeky technologies like JavaScript and Swift.
